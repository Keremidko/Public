Information about the projects.

- Bachelor_Work is my Bachelor Work project. It's a simple UML editor, 
  you can find documentation, database with sample diagrams, aswell as the source code in the Bachelor_Work folder.
  First read the README.txt file in the Bachelor_Work folder for setup instructions.  
  
- Bouncing_Circles is a project I made to test how Threads work. It generates several circles at random,
  and gives them some initial speed and direction. Each Circle movement is calculated on a separate thread.

  Basicly it's just simple code of the most common design patterns.
